    <p>
      This site is a lightweight, GitHub‑Pages‑friendly React app built with Vite.
      Routing uses a hash (/#/path) so that deep links work on GitHub Pages without extra configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      All content is editable. Replace placeholder text, update links, and enable donations when your fiscal sponsor or payment path is ready.
